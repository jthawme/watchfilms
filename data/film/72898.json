In \"Gluttony,\" a peasant family on its way to the funeral of a relative who died from indigestion stops regularly to eat and drink en route, arriving in time to eat some more. In \"Greed,\" a high-class prostitute refunds the price of a cadet's lottery ticket. In \"Pride,\" an unfaithful wife finds reason to reform.
