Unlike the miniseries, which was presented in four segments (each with opening and closing credits), the Epic is presented as a single segment.

The HBO showing contained most of the known deleted scenes, thereby lengthening the runtime of the Epic from its video release to 423 minutes.","synopsis":"The Godfather 1901–1959: The Complete Epic is a reduced, 386-minute version of the 1977 television miniseries, \"Mario Puzo's The Godfather: The Complete Novel for Television,\" released to video in 1981.
